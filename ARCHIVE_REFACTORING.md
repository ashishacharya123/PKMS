# Archive System Refactoring Documentation

**AI Agent**: Claude Sonnet 4.5  
**Date**: December 2024  
**Status**: Implementation Complete

## Overview

This document tracks the comprehensive refactoring of the archive module to address critical bugs, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues. The refactoring was implemented across 8 priority levels (P0-P6) covering transactional atomicity, performance optimization, security validation, and frontend state management.

## Changes Implemented

### P0: Transactional Atomicity (CRITICAL)

**Problem**: Multiple database commits within single operations broke ACID properties and prevented rollback on errors.

**Solution**: Removed all intermediate commits from service layer methods. Router layer now handles single final commit.

**Files Modified**:
- `pkms-backend/app/services/archive_item_service.py` (Lines 84, 90, 220, 227, 230, 268, 273)
- `pkms-backend/app/services/archive_folder_service.py` (Lines 102, 353, 411, 542, 929)
- `pkms-backend/app/routers/archive.py` (Added final commits to all endpoints)

**Impact**: Ensures data integrity - either entire operation succeeds or nothing is committed.

---

### P1: N+1 Query Bug Fix (CRITICAL)

**Problem**: Path generation queried database for every parent folder (O(depth) queries).

**Solution**: Implemented batch query approach - fetch all folders once, traverse in-memory.

**Files Modified**:
- `pkms-backend/app/services/archive_path_service.py`

**New Methods**:
- `_get_all_folders_map()`: Fetches all folders in single query
- Updated: `get_filesystem_path()`, `get_display_path()`, `get_folder_breadcrumb()`

**Performance**:
- Before: 1 + N queries (up to 10+ queries for deep folders)
- After: 1 query total
- Improvement: 90%+ reduction in database calls

---

### P2: File Upload Security & User Isolation (CRITICAL)

**Problem**: No file validation, no user isolation, potential security vulnerabilities.

**Solution**: Created comprehensive validation service and implemented user-specific storage paths.

**Files Created**:
- `pkms-backend/app/services/file_validation.py` (FileValidationService)

**Files Modified**:
- `pkms-backend/app/routers/archive.py` (Added validation to upload endpoints)
- `pkms-backend/app/services/unified_upload_service.py` (User isolation, path traversal protection)

**Security Features**:
- MIME type whitelist enforcement
- File size validation
- Dangerous content pattern detection
- Path traversal protection
- User-specific storage: `archive/{user_uuid}/`

---

### P3: Folder Delete Logic (HIGH)

**Problem**: Backend always force-deleted folders, ignoring frontend expectations.

**Solution**: Added `force` parameter with validation checks.

**Files Modified**:
- `pkms-backend/app/routers/archive.py` (Added force query parameter)
- `pkms-backend/app/services/archive_folder_service.py` (Added non-empty validation)

**Behavior**:
- `force=false`: Returns HTTP 409 if folder not empty
- `force=true`: Deletes folder and all contents

---

### P4: Frontend Type Safety & State Management (HIGH)

**Problem**: `any` types, unstable React keys, inefficient state updates.

**Solution**: Added proper TypeScript types and optimistic UI updates.

**Files Modified**:
- `pkms-frontend/src/types/archive.ts` (Added ArchivePreviewImage, ArchiveSelectedItem)
- `pkms-frontend/src/pages/ArchivePage.tsx` (Replaced any types, removed setTimeout hacks)
- `pkms-frontend/src/components/archive/FolderTree.tsx` (Fixed React keys)
- `pkms-frontend/src/stores/archiveStore.ts` (Optimistic updates)

**Improvements**:
- Type safety prevents runtime errors
- Stable keys eliminate unnecessary re-renders
- Optimistic updates improve perceived performance

---

### P5: Code Quality & API Cleanup (MEDIUM)

**Problem**: Encapsulation violations and legacy endpoints.

**Solution**: Made internal methods public where needed, removed deprecated endpoints.

**Files Modified**:
- `pkms-backend/app/services/archive_folder_service.py` (Renamed _update_folder_stats to public)
- `pkms-backend/app/routers/archive.py` (Removed PATCH rename endpoints)
- `pkms-frontend/src/services/archiveService.ts` (Updated to use PUT with JSON)

**Removed Endpoints**:
- `PATCH /archive/folders/{uuid}/rename` (replaced by PUT /archive/folders/{uuid})
- `PATCH /archive/items/{uuid}/rename` (replaced by PUT /archive/items/{uuid})

---

### P6: UX & Missing Features (MEDIUM)

**Problem**: Poor error feedback, disabled features, incomplete functionality.

**Solution**: Implemented user notifications, multi-upload reporting, and folder search.

**Files Modified**:
- `pkms-frontend/src/pages/ArchivePage.tsx` (Notifications, file deletion)
- `pkms-frontend/src/services/archiveService.ts` (Multi-upload error handling)
- `pkms-backend/app/routers/archive.py` (Search parameter)
- `pkms-backend/app/services/archive_folder_service.py` (Search implementation)

**Features Added**:
- User-facing error notifications (Mantine)
- Detailed multi-upload failure reporting
- File deletion UI (enabled)
- Folder search endpoint

## Testing Performed

- [x] Unit tests for path service
- [x] Integration tests for upload flow
- [x] Manual testing of folder operations
- [x] Security testing of file validation
- [x] Frontend type checking
- [x] Linter validation

## Known Issues

None at this time.

## Future Improvements (P7-P8)

1. **Component Refactoring**: Extract large components into smaller, reusable pieces
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Integrate query_optimization_service for proactive monitoring
3. **Caching**: Add Redis caching for frequently accessed folder trees
4. **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting to upload endpoints

## Migration Notes

**User Isolation Migration**: Existing files will need to be moved to user-specific directories:
- From: `assets/archive/{file}`
- To: `assets/archive/{user_uuid}/{file}`

Migration script should be run before deploying P2 changes.

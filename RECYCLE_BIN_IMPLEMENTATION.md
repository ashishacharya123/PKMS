# Recycle Bin Implementation - Complete Documentation

## 🎯 Overview

The Recycle Bin feature provides a comprehensive deletion lifecycle for the PKMS system, implementing a "Simple Soft Delete" architecture that allows users to safely delete items with the ability to restore them later.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Principles

1. **Simple Soft Delete**: Only sets `is_deleted = True` without unlinking associations
2. **Complex Hard Delete**: All unlinking, orphan checking, and permanent deletion logic
3. **SQLAlchemy Query Scopes**: Automatic filtering using `active_only()`, `deleted_only()`, `include_deleted()`
4. **Unified Deletion Impact Analysis**: Smart pre-deletion analysis with mode support
5. **Clean Architecture**: No obsolete orphan-checking methods in soft delete (moved to hard delete)

### Deletion Lifecycle

```
User Action → Pre-Check → Soft Delete → Recycle Bin → Restore/Hard Delete
     ↓           ↓           ↓            ↓              ↓
  Delete      Impact     Move to      View Items    Restore or
  Button    Analysis     Recycle      in Bin       Delete Forever
```

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### 1. SQLAlchemy Query Scopes

**File**: `pkms-backend/app/models/base.py`

```python
class SoftDeleteMixin:
    @declared_attr
    def is_deleted(cls):
        return Column(Boolean, default=False, nullable=False, index=True)

    @classmethod
    def active_only(cls):
        return cls.is_deleted == False

    @classmethod
    def deleted_only(cls):
        return cls.is_deleted == True

    @classmethod
    def include_deleted(cls):
        return True
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Automatic filtering in all queries
- ✅ DRY principle - no manual `is_deleted` checks
- ✅ Consistent behavior across all models
- ✅ Easy to query deleted items with `deleted_only()`

### 2. Simple Soft Delete

**Pattern Applied to All CRUD Services**:

```python
async def soft_delete_project(self, db: AsyncSession, user_uuid: str, project_uuid: str):
    """Simple soft delete - just set is_deleted = True"""
    result = await db.execute(
        select(Project).where(
            Project.active_only(),
            Project.uuid == project_uuid,
            Project.created_by == user_uuid
        )
    )
    project = result.scalar_one_or_none()
    if not project:
        raise HTTPException(404, "Project not found")
    
    project.is_deleted = True
    project.updated_at = datetime.now(NEPAL_TZ)
    await db.add(project)
    await db.commit()
    
    # Remove from search index
    await search_service.remove_item(db, project_uuid, 'project')
    dashboard_service.invalidate_user_cache(user_uuid, "project_deleted")
```

**Key Features**:
- ✅ **No unlinking** - associations stay intact
- ✅ **Fully reversible** - just flip the flag
- ✅ **Fast operation** - minimal database changes
- ✅ **Search integration** - removes from search index

### 3. Restore Functionality

**Pattern Applied to All CRUD Services**:

```python
async def restore_project(self, db: AsyncSession, user_uuid: str, project_uuid: str):
    """Restore a soft-deleted project"""
    result = await db.execute(
        select(Project).where(
            Project.deleted_only(),
            Project.uuid == project_uuid,
            Project.created_by == user_uuid
        )
    )
    project = result.scalar_one_or_none()
    if not project:
        raise HTTPException(404, "Deleted project not found")
    
    project.is_deleted = False
    project.updated_at = datetime.now(NEPAL_TZ)
    await db.add(project)
    await db.commit()
    
    # Re-index in search
    await search_service.index_item(db, project, 'project')
    dashboard_service.invalidate_user_cache(user_uuid, "project_restored")
```

**Key Features**:
- ✅ **Instant restore** - all associations reappear
- ✅ **Search integration** - re-indexes the item
- ✅ **Cache invalidation** - updates dashboard cache

### 4. Complex Hard Delete

**Example**: `permanent_delete_project()` in `project_service.py`

```python
async def permanent_delete_project(self, db: AsyncSession, user_uuid: str, project_uuid: str):
    """Complex hard delete with orphan checking"""
    # 1. Get project and verify ownership
    project = await self._get_project_for_deletion(db, user_uuid, project_uuid)
    
    # 2. Get all children before unlinking
    children_result = await db.execute(
        select(project_items.c.item_type, project_items.c.item_uuid)
        .where(project_items.c.project_uuid == project_uuid)
    )
    children = children_result.all()
    
    # 3. Unlink all children
    await db.execute(
        delete(project_items).where(project_items.c.project_uuid == project_uuid)
    )
    
    # 4. Check each child for orphan status
    for item_type, item_uuid in children:
        link_count = await association_counter_service.get_item_link_count(db, item_type, item_uuid)
        if link_count == 0:  # It's an orphan - purge it
            await self._purge_orphaned_item(db, item_type, item_uuid)
        else:
            logger.info(f"Preserving shared {item_type} {item_uuid} (still has {link_count} links)")
    
    # 5. Delete the project itself
    await db.delete(project)
    await db.commit()
```

**Key Features**:
- ✅ **Orphan detection** - only deletes truly orphaned items
- ✅ **Preserves shared items** - keeps items linked to other parents
- ✅ **Atomic operations** - all-or-nothing approach
- ✅ **Comprehensive cleanup** - handles all associations

### 5. Deletion Impact Analysis

**File**: `pkms-backend/app/services/deletion_impact_service.py`

```python
async def analyze_deletion_impact(
    self, db: AsyncSession, item_type: str, item_uuid: str, user_uuid: str,
    mode: str = "soft"
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Analyze deletion impact with mode support"""
    
    if mode == "soft":
        return {
            "can_delete": True,
            "warnings": [f"This will move the {item_type} to the Recycle Bin. It can be restored later."],
            "blockers": [],
            "impact_summary": "Soft delete - fully reversible",
            "orphan_items": [],
            "preserved_items": []
        }
    elif mode == "hard":
        # Complex analysis for hard delete
        # Check associations, orphan status, etc.
        return await self._analyze_hard_delete_impact(db, item_type, item_uuid, user_uuid)
```

**Key Features**:
- ✅ **Mode-aware analysis** - different logic for soft vs hard delete
- ✅ **User-friendly warnings** - clear impact descriptions
- ✅ **Blocking conditions** - prevents dangerous deletions
- ✅ **Detailed breakdown** - shows what will be affected

### 6. Frontend Recycle Bin Interface

**File**: `pkms-frontend/src/pages/RecycleBinPage.tsx`

**Features**:
- ✅ **Tabbed interface** - All Items, Projects, Notes, Todos, Documents, Diary, Archive
- ✅ **Smart filtering** - only shows parent items, not exclusive children
- ✅ **Restore actions** - one-click restore with loading states
- ✅ **Permanent delete** - with impact analysis and warnings
- ✅ **Empty bin** - bulk permanent deletion with confirmation
- ✅ **Loading states** - skeleton loaders and progress indicators
- ✅ **Error handling** - comprehensive error messages and notifications

**Key Components**:
```typescript
// Main page with tabbed interface
<RecycleBinPage />

// Smart deletion dialog
<DeletionImpactDialog 
  mode="soft" 
  itemType="project" 
  itemUuid={uuid} 
  onDeleteSuccess={handleSuccess} 
/>

// Hard delete confirmation
<PermanentDeleteDialog 
  itemType="project" 
  itemUuid={uuid} 
  onDeleteSuccess={handleSuccess} 
/>
```

### 7. API Endpoints

**New Endpoints Added**:

```python

```

## 🚀 Usage Guide

### For Users

1. **Deleting Items**:
   - Click "Delete" on any item
   - See impact analysis dialog
   - Choose to move to Recycle Bin
   - Item disappears from main view

2. **Managing Recycle Bin**:
   - Click "Recycle Bin" in user menu
   - Browse deleted items by module
   - Restore items with one click
   - Permanently delete items with confirmation

3. **Restoring Items**:
   - Go to Recycle Bin
   - Find the item you want to restore
   - Click "Restore" button
   - Item reappears in main view with all associations intact

### For Developers

1. **Adding New Modules**:
   ```python
   # 1. Add to SoftDeleteMixin (already done)
   class YourModel(Base, SoftDeleteMixin):
       # Your fields here
   
   # 2. Add restore method to CRUD service
   async def restore_your_item(self, db: AsyncSession, user_uuid: str, item_uuid: str):
       # Implementation following the pattern
   
   # 3. Add /deleted endpoint to router
   @router.get("/deleted", response_model=List[YourItemResponse])
   async def list_deleted_your_items():
       # Implementation
   
   # 4. Add restore endpoint
   @router.post("/{item_uuid}/restore")
   async def restore_your_item():
       # Implementation
   ```

2. **Query Patterns**:
   ```python
   # Active items only (default)
   query = select(YourModel).where(YourModel.active_only())
   
   # Deleted items only
   query = select(YourModel).where(YourModel.deleted_only())
   
   # All items (including deleted)
   query = select(YourModel).where(YourModel.include_deleted())
   ```

## 🧪 Testing

### Backend Testing

```bash
# Test compilation
python -c "import app.models.base; import app.services.project_service; print('✅ Backend compiles')"

# Test specific services
python -c "from app.services.deletion_impact_service import deletion_impact_service; print('✅ Deletion impact service works')"
```

### Frontend Testing

```bash
# Test frontend compilation
cd pkms-frontend
npm run build

# Test specific components
npm run test -- RecycleBinPage
```

### Integration Testing

1. **Soft Delete Flow**:
   - Create a project with documents
   - Delete the project
   - Verify it appears in Recycle Bin
   - Verify documents are still linked

2. **Restore Flow**:
   - Restore the project from Recycle Bin
   - Verify it reappears in main view
   - Verify all documents are still linked

3. **Hard Delete Flow**:
   - Delete project permanently
   - Verify orphaned documents are also deleted
   - Verify shared documents are preserved

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Items not appearing in Recycle Bin**:
   - Check if `is_deleted = True` in database
   - Verify query is using `deleted_only()` scope
   - Check user ownership

2. **Restore not working**:
   - Verify item exists and is soft-deleted
   - Check user permissions
   - Verify search service is working

3. **Hard delete issues**:
   - Check association counting logic
   - Verify orphan detection is working
   - Check file deletion permissions

### Debug Queries

```python
# Check soft-deleted items
from app.models.project import Project
from sqlalchemy import select

# Get all soft-deleted projects
deleted_projects = await db.execute(
    select(Project).where(Project.deleted_only())
).scalars().all()

# Check associations
from app.services.association_counter_service import association_counter_service
link_count = await association_counter_service.get_item_link_count(db, "project", project_uuid)
```

## 📊 Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization

1. **Indexes**: `is_deleted` column is indexed for fast filtering
2. **Query Scopes**: Automatic filtering reduces query complexity
3. **Batch Operations**: Bulk operations for empty recycle bin
4. **Eager Loading**: Tags and associations loaded efficiently

### Frontend Optimization

1. **Lazy Loading**: Items loaded on demand per tab
2. **Caching**: Deleted items cached for quick access
3. **Loading States**: Skeleton loaders for better UX
4. **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling

## 🔒 Security Considerations

1. **User Isolation**: Users can only see their own deleted items
2. **Permission Checks**: All operations verify user ownership
3. **Audit Trail**: All deletion/restore operations are logged
4. **Data Integrity**: Atomic operations prevent partial states

## 🎉 Benefits Achieved

### For Users
- ✅ **Safe Deletion**: Items can be restored if deleted by mistake
- ✅ **Clear Interface**: Easy to manage deleted items
- ✅ **Smart Warnings**: Understand impact before deleting
- ✅ **Bulk Operations**: Empty entire recycle bin at once

### For Developers
- ✅ **Clean Architecture**: Separation of soft/hard delete logic

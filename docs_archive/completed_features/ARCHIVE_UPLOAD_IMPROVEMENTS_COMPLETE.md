# Archive Upload & Archiving Improvements Complete

**AI Agent:** Claude Sonnet 4  
**Date:** 2025-01-16  
**Task:** Improve archive upload system and add missing archiving functionality

## ✅ All Improvements Completed

### 1. 🔄 Unified Upload Service (No More Small/Large File Distinction)

**Problem:** Archive service had different logic for small files (< 3MB) vs large files  
**Solution:** All files now use the chunked upload service consistently

**Changed Files:**
- `pkms-frontend/src/services/archiveService.ts`

**What Changed:**
- ✅ Removed `LARGE_FILE_THRESHOLD` and size-based routing
- ✅ Replaced `uploadSmallFile` and `uploadLargeFile` with unified `uploadFileUnified`
- ✅ All files use `coreUploadService.uploadFile()` → chunked upload → commit pattern
- ✅ Added `uploadMultipleFiles()` method for batch uploads

**Benefits:**
- 🔹 **Consistent behavior**: All uploads work the same way
- 🔹 **Better reliability**: Chunked uploads are more resilient to network issues
- 🔹 **No confusion**: No need to think about file size thresholds
- 🔹 **Better progress tracking**: Unified progress reporting

### 2. 📝 Notes Archive Functionality

**Problem:** Notes had `is_archived` field but no archive endpoint or UI  
**Solution:** Added complete archive functionality to match documents and todos

**Backend Changes:**
- `pkms-backend/app/routers/notes.py`
  - ✅ Added `PATCH /notes/{note_id}/archive` endpoint
  - ✅ Follows same pattern as documents and todos
  - ✅ Proper error handling and logging

**Frontend Changes:**
- `pkms-frontend/src/services/notesService.ts`
  - ✅ Updated `toggleArchive()` to use new endpoint instead of generic update
- `pkms-frontend/src/pages/NoteViewPage.tsx`
  - ✅ Fixed missing notifications import

**UI Features (Already Existed!):**
- ✅ Archive/unarchive buttons in notes list menu
- ✅ Archive/unarchive button in note view page
- ✅ Archive status badges
- ✅ Filter to show/hide archived notes
- ✅ Visual feedback with notifications

### 3. 📁 Multiple File Upload UI

**Problem:** Backend supported multiple files but UI only allowed single file upload  
**Solution:** Enhanced Archive page to support multiple file selection and upload

**Changed Files:**
- `pkms-frontend/src/pages/ArchivePage.tsx`
- `pkms-frontend/src/stores/archiveStore.ts`

**New Features:**
- ✅ **Multiple file selection**: `multiple` attribute on FileInput
- ✅ **Smart upload logic**: Single file uses store, multiple files use service directly
- ✅ **Visual feedback**: 
  - Shows "X files selected" badge when multiple files chosen
  - Different button text: "Upload File" vs "Upload 5 Files"
  - Progress tracking for multiple uploads
- ✅ **Robust error handling**: Continues uploading other files if one fails
- ✅ **Auto-refresh**: Folder items refresh after successful multiple upload
- ✅ **Notifications**: Success/failure feedback

**Upload Flow:**
1. **Single File**: Uses existing store `uploadFile()` method
2. **Multiple Files**: Uses new `archiveService.uploadMultipleFiles()` method
3. **Progress**: Shows overall progress + current file progress
4. **Completion**: Refreshes folder contents and shows success notification

### 4. 🗄️ Archived Items Viewing Strategy

**Current System Analysis:**

| Module | Archive Method | Where Archived Items Appear |
|--------|---------------|----------------------------|
| **Documents** | `is_archived` flag | ✅ Same module with "Show Archived" toggle |
| **Notes** | `is_archived` flag | ✅ Same module with "Show Archived" toggle |
| **Todos** | `is_archived` flag | ✅ Same module with "Show Archived" toggle |
| **Archive Module** | Files copied to archive | ✅ Archive module as permanent storage |

**Recommendation: KEEP CURRENT HYBRID APPROACH** ✅

This is actually the **best of both worlds**:

#### For Notes, Documents, Todos:
- **✅ Archive = Hide from main view** (like Gmail archive)
- **✅ Still accessible** in same module with "Show Archived" toggle
- **✅ Can be unarchived** easily
- **✅ Maintains context** within original module

#### For Archive Module:
- **✅ Archive = Permanent organized storage**
- **✅ Hierarchical folders** for organization
- **✅ Different purpose**: Long-term file storage vs temporary hiding

**Why This Approach Works:**
1. **Different use cases**: Module archiving (temporary hide) vs Archive module (permanent storage)
2. **User mental model**: Users understand "archive to get out of the way" vs "store in archive"
3. **No confusion**: Clear separation of purposes
4. **Flexibility**: Users can choose appropriate method for their needs

## 📊 Summary of Improvements

### Backend Changes:
- ✅ **Notes archive endpoint**: `PATCH /notes/{note_id}/archive`
- ✅ **Consistent patterns**: All modules follow same archive pattern

### Frontend Changes:
- ✅ **Unified upload service**: All files use chunked upload
- ✅ **Multiple file uploads**: Enhanced UI with progress tracking
- ✅ **Notes archive integration**: Service method updated to use new endpoint
- ✅ **Better error handling**: Robust multiple upload with partial failure support

### User Experience:
- ✅ **No confusion**: All uploads work consistently
- ✅ **Multiple file support**: Can select and upload multiple files at once
- ✅ **Better feedback**: Progress tracking and notifications for all operations
- ✅ **Notes archiving**: Now works like documents and todos
- ✅ **Clear archive strategy**: Different purposes for different modules

## 🎯 How to Use

### Upload Files to Archive:
1. **Navigate to Archive page**
2. **Select folder** from folder tree
3. **Choose files**: 
   - Single file: Select one file
   - Multiple files: Select multiple files (shows "X files selected")
4. **Click Upload**: Button shows "Upload File" or "Upload X Files"
5. **Watch progress**: 
   - Single file: Standard progress bar
   - Multiple files: Overall progress + current file progress
6. **Success**: Files appear in folder, notification confirms

### Archive Items in Modules:
- **Notes**: Menu → Archive (moves to archived section, can unarchive)
- **Documents**: Archive button → copies to Archive module + marks as archived
- **Todos**: Menu → Archive (hides from active todos, can unarchive)

### View Archived Items:
- **Each module**: Toggle "Show Archived" to see archived items in that module
- **Archive module**: Browse organized folder structure for permanently stored files

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Upload Service Changes:
```typescript
// OLD: Size-based routing
if (file.size < LARGE_FILE_THRESHOLD) {
  return uploadSmallFile(file, folderUuid, onProgress);
}
return uploadLargeFile(file, folderUuid, onProgress);

// NEW: Unified chunked upload
return uploadFileUnified(file, folderUuid, onProgress);
```

### Multiple Upload Implementation:
```typescript
// New method
async uploadMultipleFiles(
  files: File[],
  folderUuid: string,
  onProgress?: (progress: { fileIndex: number; fileName: string; progress: UploadProgress }) => void
): Promise<ArchiveItem[]>
```

### Archive Endpoint Pattern:
```typescript
// All modules follow this pattern
PATCH /notes/{id}/archive?archive=true
PATCH /todos/{id}/archive?archive=true
POST /documents/{id}/archive (special - copies to archive module)
```

---

**Result**: Archive system is now uniform, reliable, and feature-complete with excellent UX! 🎉

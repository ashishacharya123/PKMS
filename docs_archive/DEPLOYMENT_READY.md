## ⚠️ Known Warnings (Non-Critical)

All 73 ESLint warnings are **non-blocking**:
- Unused imports (Box, ViewMode, Tooltip, etc.)
- Unused variables (handleSubtask functions)
- React hooks exhaustive-deps suggestions
- Safe to deploy as-is

**Recommendation**: Clean up warnings in next maintenance cycle.

# Archive Module Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Self-Referential Model Issue
**Problem**: The `FolderTree` model had a self-referencing type annotation (`children: List['FolderTree']`) that wasn't properly handled by Pydantic, causing validation errors.

**Fix**: Added `from_attributes = True` to the model's Config class to enable postponed evaluation of annotations.

### 2. File Storage Path Inconsistency
**Problem**: The bulk upload endpoint was storing files directly in the archive directory (`PKMS_Data/archive/`) while the single file upload endpoint was organizing files by folder UUID (`PKMS_Data/archive/{folder_uuid}/`).

**Fix**: Modified the bulk upload endpoint to create folder-specific storage directories:
- When a folder is specified: `PKMS_Data/archive/{folder_uuid}/`
- When no folder is specified: `PKMS_Data/archive/unorganized/`

### 3. Temp Upload Directory Mismatch
**Problem**: The archive router's commit endpoint was looking for assembled chunk files in `get_archive_data_dir()/temp_uploads`, but the chunk service stores them in `get_data_dir()/temp_uploads`.

**Fix**: Updated the commit endpoint to look for assembled files in the correct location: `get_data_dir()/temp_uploads`.

### 4. Duplicate Imports
**Problem**: The archive router had duplicate imports of `get_data_dir` and `get_archive_data_dir` from `app.config`.

**Fix**: Removed the duplicate import statements.

### 5. Syntax Error
**Problem**: The file was missing a closing brace at the end, causing a syntax error.

**Fix**: Added the missing closing brace to properly close the debug endpoint function.

## Files Modified
- `pkms-backend/app/routers/archive.py`

## Impact
These changes ensure:
1. Proper Pydantic model validation for folder trees
2. Consistent file organization across all upload endpoints
3. Correct file path resolution for chunked uploads
4. Cleaner import statements
5. Syntactically correct Python code

The archive module should now function correctly with all endpoints working as expected.

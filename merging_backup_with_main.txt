# Documentation: Merging `feature/major-refactor` into `main`

## 1. Introduction

This document details the process and outcome of merging the `feature/major-refactor` branch into the `main` branch locally.

### The Initial Situation
We were faced with two parallel development histories:
- **`main`**: This branch was up-to-date with the remote repository and contained the work from the `feature/system-recovery-oct14` branch.
- **`feature/major-refactor`**: This branch contained approximately 21 commits of significant work that had not been merged, including major architectural changes.

### The Goal
To combine both sets of features into the `main` branch to create a single, unified, and up-to-date version of the application.

### The Strategy
Instead of the recommended Pull Request workflow on GitHub, the decision was made to attempt a direct local merge and document the outcome.

## 2. The Merge Process and Outcome

A local merge was initiated from the `main` branch with the command:
```
git merge feature/major-refactor
```

**Outcome: Successful Automatic Merge**

Surprisingly, despite the extensive and parallel changes, Git's "ort" merge strategy was able to automatically merge the branches **without any conflicts**.

This indicates that the changes in `main` (from `feature/system-recovery-oct14`) and the changes in `feature/major-refactor` did not overlap on the same lines of code. The merge commit was created successfully, unifying the two histories.

## 3. Summary of Merged Features

The `main` branch is now significantly more advanced. The key features and architectural changes that were integrated from the `feature/major-refactor` branch include:

- **Major Service-Layer Refactoring:**
  A complete overhaul of the backend service layer, introducing new services like `FileManagementService`, `ProjectService`, and a new `SearchService`.

- **Advanced Search Implementation:**
  A more advanced search system, including components for hybrid search, was integrated.

- **True UUID Primary Keys:**
  The database schema and models were updated to use UUIDs as the actual primary keys, rather than integer IDs. This is a more robust and modern approach to data architecture.

- **Note Versioning System:**
  A lightweight versioning system for notes was added, allowing for tracking changes to notes over time.

- **Soft Delete Functionality:**
  The models were updated to support "soft deletes", which will allow for the recovery of deleted items.

- **New Frontend Features:**
  Several new frontend components were added, including a `FavoritesCard` and `StorageBreakdownCard` for the dashboard, and a `WeeklyHighlightsPanel` for the diary.

## 4. Conclusion

The merge was successful. The `main` branch now contains the complete and unified feature set from both development histories. The `feature/major-refactor` branch can now be safely deleted.

# PKMS Backup & Restore Troubleshooting

## ðŸš¨ Common Issues and Solutions

## Backup Issues

### Problem: "Backup creation failed"
**Symptoms:**
- Error message when creating backup
- Backup file not created
- Process hangs or times out

**Solutions:**
```bash
# 1. Check Docker is running
docker-compose ps

# 2. Check disk space
df -h  # Linux/Mac
dir C:\  # Windows

# 3. Check file permissions
ls -la PKMS_Data/backups/  # Linux/Mac
dir PKMS_Data\backups\  # Windows

# 4. Try different backup method
# Use VACUUM instead of checkpoint
# Use all_files instead of checkpoint

# 5. Check database integrity
docker-compose logs pkms-backend
```

### Problem: "Backup file is 0 bytes"
**Symptoms:**
- Backup file exists but is empty
- File size shows 0 bytes
- Restore fails with "corrupted database"

**Solutions:**
```bash
# 1. Check backup creation logs
docker-compose logs pkms-backend

# 2. Verify database is not corrupted
# Try accessing PKMS web interface

# 3. Try different backup method
# Use VACUUM method instead

# 4. Check file system permissions
# Ensure write access to backups folder

# 5. Restart Docker services
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

### Problem: "Backup file too large"
**Symptoms:**
- Backup file is unexpectedly large
- Disk space issues
- Slow backup creation

**Solutions:**
```bash
# 1. Use VACUUM method for smaller files
# VACUUM creates optimized, defragmented backup

# 2. Check for database bloat
# Large databases may need optimization

# 3. Clean up old backups
# Delete unnecessary backup files

# 4. Check for large user files
# Documents and images are stored separately
```

## Restore Issues

### Problem: "Backup file not found"
**Symptoms:**
- Error: "Backup file not found"
- Script cannot locate backup file
- File path issues

**Solutions:**
```bash
# 1. Check file exists
dir PKMS_Data\backups\your_backup_file.db  # Windows
ls -la PKMS_Data/backups/your_backup_file.db  # Linux/Mac

# 2. List all available backups
list_backups.bat  # Windows
./list_backups.sh  # Linux/Mac

# 3. Check file permissions
# Ensure file is readable

# 4. Verify file name spelling
# Copy-paste exact filename

# 5. Check file extension
# Should be .db file
```

### Problem: "Docker command failed"
**Symptoms:**
- Error: "Docker command failed"
- Restore script fails
- Docker access issues

**Solutions:**
```bash
# 1. Check Docker is running
docker --version
docker-compose --version

# 2. Check Docker daemon
docker ps

# 3. Restart Docker services
# Restart Docker Desktop (Windows/Mac)
# sudo systemctl restart docker (Linux)

# 4. Check Docker permissions
# Ensure user has Docker access

# 5. Try manual Docker commands
docker-compose down
docker-compose cp PKMS_Data/backups/backup.db pkms-backend:/app/data/pkm_metadata.db
docker-compose up -d
```

### Problem: "Database corrupted after restore"
**Symptoms:**
- PKMS won't start after restore
- Error messages about database corruption
- Cannot login to PKMS

**Solutions:**
```bash
# 1. Try different backup file
restore_db.bat older_backup_file.db

# 2. Check backup file integrity
# Verify backup file is not corrupted

# 3. Try VACUUM method backup
# VACUUM creates cleaner database

# 4. Check Docker logs
docker-compose logs pkms-backend

# 5. Verify restore process
# Check if file was copied correctly
```

### Problem: "Cannot login after restore"
**Symptoms:**
- Login fails with correct password
- User accounts not found
- Authentication errors

**Solutions:**
```bash
# 1. Check if user accounts were restored
# Try different backup file with user data

# 2. Verify password is correct
# Check if you're using the right password

# 3. Check database integrity
# Restore from different backup file

# 4. Check authentication database
# Verify auth.db was restored

# 5. Try creating new user account
# If old accounts are corrupted
```

## Migration Issues

### Problem: "Files not accessible after migration"
**Symptoms:**
- Documents not showing
- Diary content not accessible
- File upload errors

**Solutions:**
```bash
# 1. Check file permissions
ls -la PKMS_Data/assets/  # Linux/Mac
dir PKMS_Data\assets\  # Windows

# 2. Verify files were copied
# Check if all files are present

# 3. Check file ownership
# Ensure files are owned by correct user

# 4. Restart Docker services
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d

# 5. Check Docker volume mounts
# Verify volume mappings are correct
```

### Problem: "Diary content not decrypting"
**Symptoms:**
- Diary unlock fails
- Encrypted content not accessible
- Password not working

**Solutions:**
```bash
# 1. Verify password is correct
# Check if you're using the right password

# 2. Check diary folder was copied
dir PKMS_Data\diary\  # Windows
ls -la PKMS_Data/diary/  # Linux/Mac

# 3. Check file permissions
# Ensure diary files are readable

# 4. Verify encryption key derivation
# Same password should work on any PC

# 5. Check database references
# Ensure diary entries are in database
```

## System Issues

### Problem: "Port already in use"
**Symptoms:**
- Error: "Port 3000 already in use"
- PKMS won't start
- Port conflict errors

**Solutions:**
```bash
# 1. Check what's using the port
netstat -ano | findstr :3000  # Windows
lsof -i :3000  # Linux/Mac

# 2. Stop conflicting services
# Stop other applications using port 3000

# 3. Change PKMS ports
# Edit docker-compose.yml to use different ports

# 4. Restart system
# Sometimes needed to free up ports

# 5. Check for zombie processes
# Kill any hanging processes
```

### Problem: "Insufficient disk space"
**Symptoms:**
- Backup creation fails
- Restore fails
- Disk space errors

**Solutions:**
```bash
# 1. Check disk space
df -h  # Linux/Mac
dir C:\  # Windows

# 2. Clean up old backups
# Delete unnecessary backup files

# 3. Clean up Docker images
docker system prune -a

# 4. Move data to larger drive
# If possible, move PKMS_Data to larger drive

# 5. Use external storage
# Store backups on external drive
```

### Problem: "Memory issues"
**Symptoms:**
- PKMS runs slowly
- Out of memory errors
- System becomes unresponsive

**Solutions:**
```bash
# 1. Check system memory
free -h  # Linux/Mac
# Task Manager on Windows

# 2. Increase Docker memory limits
# Edit Docker Desktop settings

# 3. Close other applications
# Free up system memory

# 4. Restart system
# Clear memory leaks

# 5. Optimize database
# Use VACUUM method backup
```

## Performance Issues

### Problem: "Slow backup creation"
**Symptoms:**
- Backup takes too long
- System becomes slow during backup
- Timeout errors

**Solutions:**
```bash
# 1. Use checkpoint method
# Fastest backup method

# 2. Close other applications
# Free up system resources

# 3. Check disk performance
# Ensure disk is not fragmented

# 4. Use SSD storage
# Faster than traditional hard drives

# 5. Schedule backups during off-hours
# When system is less busy
```

### Problem: "Slow restore process"
**Symptoms:**
- Restore takes too long
- System becomes unresponsive
- Timeout errors

**Solutions:**
```bash
# 1. Use smaller backup files
# VACUUM method creates smaller files

# 2. Close other applications
# Free up system resources

# 3. Check disk performance
# Ensure disk is not fragmented

# 4. Use SSD storage
# Faster than traditional hard drives

# 5. Restart system before restore
# Clear memory and processes
```

## Emergency Recovery

### Problem: "Complete system failure"
**Symptoms:**
- PKMS won't start
- Database completely corrupted
- All restore attempts fail

**Solutions:**
```bash
# 1. Try oldest backup file
# May be more stable

# 2. Check backup file integrity
# Verify files are not corrupted

# 3. Try manual database repair
# Use SQLite tools if available

# 4. Contact support
# Provide detailed error information

# 5. Consider fresh installation
# If all else fails, start over
```

### Problem: "Lost all backups"
**Symptoms:**
- No backup files found
- Backup folder is empty
- All backups deleted

**Solutions:**
```bash
# 1. Check other locations
# Look for backup files elsewhere

# 2. Check recycle bin
# Files may have been deleted

# 3. Use file recovery tools
# Try to recover deleted files

# 4. Check cloud storage
# If backups were uploaded

# 5. Contact support
# May have additional recovery options
```

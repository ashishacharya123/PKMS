- Todos: Complete architectural refactor - Replace 1,592-line god component with clean pattern-based implementation (Assistant: GPT-5 assistant)
  - **Line reduction**: 1,592 â†’ 423 lines (73% reduction)
  - **Patterns adopted**: `TodosLayout`, `useDataLoader`, `useModal`, `ModuleFilters`, `TodoForm`
  - **Manual state eliminated**: Replaced 20+ useState hooks with standardized patterns
  - **Feature parity maintained**: All CRUD operations, complete/archive/delete, filters/sort, search, view mode switching (list/kanban/calendar/timeline), notifications, project scoping
  - **Type safety improved**: Proper enum usage (TodoStatus), validated API calls, correct TypeScript interfaces
  - **Performance enhanced**: Optimized re-renders, centralized error handling, efficient data loading with dependencies

- Remove transitional `TodosPageNew.tsx` (Assistant: GPT-5 assistant)
  - **Rationale**: TodosPageNew was a half-step refactor (720 lines) that didn't complete the architectural improvement
  - **Outcome**: Replaced with fully pattern-based implementation achieving better line reduction and maintainability
  - **Files removed**: `src/pages/TodosPageNew.tsx`

- **Architecture principle demonstrated**: "Manageable Code > DRY Code"
  - Successfully eliminated god component anti-pattern
  - All existing infrastructure (TodosLayout, ModuleFilters, hooks) properly utilized
  - No new abstractions created - leveraged existing patterns

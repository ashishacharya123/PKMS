- Todos: Complete architectural refactor - Replace 1,592-line god component with clean pattern-based implementation (Assistant: GPT-5 assistant)
  - **Line reduction**: 1,592 → 423 lines (73% reduction)
  - **Patterns adopted**: `TodosLayout`, `useDataLoader`, `useModal`, `ModuleFilters`, `TodoForm`
  - **Manual state eliminated**: Replaced 20+ useState hooks with standardized patterns
  - **Feature parity maintained**: All CRUD operations, complete/archive/delete, filters/sort, search, view mode switching (list/kanban/calendar/timeline), notifications, project scoping
  - **Type safety improved**: Proper enum usage (TodoStatus), validated API calls, correct TypeScript interfaces
  - **Performance enhanced**: Optimized re-renders, centralized error handling, efficient data loading with dependencies

- Remove transitional `TodosPageNew.tsx` (Assistant: GPT-5 assistant)
  - **Rationale**: TodosPageNew was a half-step refactor (720 lines) that didn't complete the architectural improvement
  - **Outcome**: Replaced with fully pattern-based implementation achieving better line reduction and maintainability
  - **Files removed**: `src/pages/TodosPageNew.tsx`

- **Architecture principle demonstrated**: "Manageable Code > DRY Code"
  - Successfully eliminated god component anti-pattern
  - All existing infrastructure (TodosLayout, ModuleFilters, hooks) properly utilized
  - No new abstractions created - leveraged existing patterns

- Projects: Architectural improvements with existing patterns (Assistant: GPT-5 assistant)
  - **Line optimization**: 583 → 579 lines with significant architectural improvements
  - **Pattern adoption**: Replaced manual loading with `useDataLoader` hook
  - **Modal management**: Standardized using `useModal` hook for create/edit/filter/duplicate modals
  - **UUID reservation**: Maintained existing entity reservation functionality within new patterns
  - **Performance enhanced**: Centralized data loading with automatic refetch capability
  - **Code consistency**: All handlers now use `useCallback` for proper memoization

- Documents: Modal management improvements with existing patterns (Assistant: GPT-5 assistant)
  - **Line optimization**: 839 → 865 lines (architectural improvements prioritized over line reduction)
  - **Modal management**: Replaced manual modal states with `useModal` hook for upload, filter, and image preview
  - **Pattern adoption**: Added LoadingState and ErrorState imports for future improvements
  - **Memory management**: Improved URL cleanup for image previews through proper modal lifecycle
  - **Callback optimization**: Added `useCallback` handlers for better performance
  - **Foundation established**: Set up useDataLoader pattern for future store integration
  - **File operations**: Maintained all existing upload, preview, and document management functionality

- Notes: Modal management and data loading improvements with existing patterns (Assistant: GPT-5 assistant)
  - **Line optimization**: 713 → 690 lines (light architectural refactor)
  - **Data loading**: Replaced manual `loadNotes()` with `useDataLoader` hook for automatic fetching and caching
  - **Modal management**: Replaced manual `filtersOpened` state with `useModal` hook for filter modal
  - **State elimination**: Removed manual `isLoading`, `error`, and `notes` state variables
  - **Performance enhanced**: Added `useCallback` handlers for delete operation and filter modal
  - **Error handling**: Integrated with useDataLoader error handling while maintaining Alert display
  - **Feature parity maintained**: All note operations, filtering, pagination, and view modes preserved

- ProjectDashboard: Mindful architectural improvements for complex dashboard (Assistant: GPT-5 assistant)
  - **Line optimization**: 994 → 1037 lines (architectural improvements prioritized over line reduction for complex functionality)
  - **Dual data loading**: Replaced manual `loadProjectData()` with two `useDataLoader` hooks (project details + project items)
  - **Modal management**: Added `useModal` hook for delete confirmation with proper callback separation
  - **Complex functionality preserved**: Maintained drag-and-drop document reordering with `useCallback` handlers
  - **Error handling**: Added combined error handling with proper fallback states and user feedback
  - **Loading states**: Implemented combined loading state for both project and items data
  - **Performance enhanced**: All handlers now use `useCallback` with proper dependencies
  - **Type safety improved**: Fixed type issues with `UnifiedFileItem`, `TodoSummary`, and project properties
  - **Defensive programming**: Added proper error boundaries and loading states for late development stability

- Service Architecture: Project-scoped filtering and legacy field cleanup (Assistant: GPT-5 assistant)
  - **Server-side filtering**: Added projectId support to eliminate client-side filtering bottlenecks
  - **Service enhancements**:
    - `notesService.listNotes({ projectId })` now accepts projectId and converts to project_id URL parameter
    - `unifiedFileService.listDocuments({ projectId })` now passes project_id to backend alongside existing projectUuid support
    - `todosService.getTodos({ projectId })` already supported projectId parameter
  - **Performance improvement**: ProjectDashboardPage now uses server-side filtering instead of broad fetch + client-side filter
  - **Legacy field migration**: Replaced todo_count/completed_count with todoCount/completedCount across all pages
  - **API consistency**: Removed project.color usage (backend removed this field), standardized to fixed color values
  - **Type safety**: Eliminated (item as any) casts in ProjectDashboardPage, added proper type guards
  - **Code cleanup**: Removed temporary client-side filtering code, improved maintainability

- UnifiedFileList: Modal pattern standardization (Assistant: GPT-5 assistant)
  - **Modal refactoring**: Replaced 3 manual modal states with standardized `useModal` hooks
  - **Patterns adopted**: `contentModal`, `imageModal`, `todoModal` for consistent modal management
  - **Handler updates**: Updated all modal handlers to use new pattern-based approach
  - **JSX cleanup**: Updated modal components to use new modal state structure
  - **Memory management**: Improved URL cleanup for blob URLs through proper modal lifecycle
  - **Feature parity**: Maintained all existing functionality (image viewing, TODO viewing, content editing)
  - **Syntax fixes**: Resolved modal component structure issues and TypeScript errors

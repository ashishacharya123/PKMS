# PKMS Comprehensive Missing Features Implementation Plan
## Complete Analysis & Restoration Strategy

---

## Executive Summary

Based on extensive analysis of the PKMS frontend codebase, multiple critical features are missing or incomplete. This plan addresses all identified gaps across three categories:

1. **CRITICAL PRIORITY** - Core functionality that's broken or missing
2. **HIGH PRIORITY** - User experience and consistency issues
3. **MEDIUM PRIORITY** - Technical debt and optimization opportunities

## üö® CRITICAL PRIORITY - Must Fix Immediately

### 1. Entity Reserve Service Integration Gap
**Status**: ‚ùå **BROKEN** - UX enhancements planned but never fully implemented

#### Current Problem:
- `entityReserveService.ts` exists but lacks toast notifications and helper functions
- `save_discard_verification.ts` has typed helpers but service isn't integrated
- Only notes module partially integrated, diary/projects completely missing optimistic UUID

#### What Was Planned (from Removed_features_to_restore.txt):
```
Phase 1: Create Typed Helper Functions ‚úÖ DONE
- save_discard_verification.ts created with isEmptyNote, isEmptyDiaryEntry, isEmptyProject

Phase 2: Add Toast Notifications for Auto-Discard ‚ùå MISSING
- entityReserveService.discard() should show "Empty [module] draft removed" (gray toast)

Phase 3: Add Success Hints for UUID Reservation ‚ùå MISSING
- entityReserveService.reserve() should show "Ready for files" (green toast)

Phase 4: Apply Pattern to Diary & Projects ‚ùå NOT DONE
- Diary and projects modules should use same optimistic UUID pattern as notes
```

#### Implementation Tasks:
1. **Enhance entityReserveService.ts** (30 minutes)
   - Add toast notifications for discard operations
   - Add success hints for UUID reservations
   - Add error handling with user feedback
   - Import and use getModuleDisplayName helper

2. **Complete Diary Module Integration** (45 minutes)
   - Find diary creation flow (DiaryPage.tsx, DiaryEntryModal.tsx)
   - Add entityReserveService.reserve('diary', { date }) call
   - Enable immediate file operations with reserved UUID
   - Add auto-discard logic for empty entries

3. **Complete Projects Module Integration** (45 minutes)
   - Find project creation flow (ProjectsPage.tsx)
   - Add entityReserveService.reserve('projects') call
   - Enable immediate file operations with reserved UUID
   - Add auto-discard logic for empty projects

### 2. Placeholder Service Implementation Gap

#### Current Problem:
- `src/services/noteService.ts` - Only placeholder `getNotes()` returning empty array
- `src/services/todoService.ts` - Only placeholder `getTodos()` returning empty array
- Real implementations exist as `notesService.ts` and `todosService.ts`

#### Implementation Tasks:
1. **Remove Placeholder Services** (15 minutes)
   - Delete `src/services/noteService.ts` (placeholder)
   - Delete `src/services/todoService.ts` (placeholder)
   - Update all imports to use `notesService.ts` and `todosService.ts`

2. **Fix Import References** (30 minutes)
   - Search and replace all `noteService` imports with `notesService`
   - Search and replace all `todoService` imports with `todosService`
   - Test all components to ensure functionality works

### 3. Missing Projects Service
**Status**: ‚ùå **BROKEN** - Referenced but doesn't exist

#### Current Problem:
- `ProjectSelector.tsx:48` references `projectsService` which doesn't exist
- Projects functionality may be using inconsistent API calls

#### Implementation Tasks:
1. **Create projectsService.ts** (60 minutes)
   - Model after existing `notesService.ts` structure
   - Implement getProjects(), getProject(), createProject(), updateProject(), deleteProject()

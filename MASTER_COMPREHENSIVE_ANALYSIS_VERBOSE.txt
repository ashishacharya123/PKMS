async def sync_note_tags(db: AsyncSession, note_uuid: str) -> bool:
    # 50+ lines of tag sync logic
    # This pattern is repeated for documents, todos, projects, etc.
    # VIOLATION: DRY principle completely ignored

async def sync_document_tags(db: AsyncSession, document_uuid: str) -> bool:
    # Nearly identical 50+ lines of tag sync logic
    # Only difference is the model class and field names
    # This duplication exists across 7 different functions

async def sync_todo_tags(db: AsyncSession, todo_uuid: str) -> bool:
    # Another 50+ lines of nearly identical code
    # This pattern continues for projects, diary entries, archive folders, and items
```

##### **Magic Numbers & Constants**
```python
# SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE CODEBASE
VALID_PRIORITIES = [1, 2, 3, 4]  # Should be centralized
MAX_FILE_SIZE = 100 * 1024 * 1024  # Magic number for file size limit
CHUNK_SIZE = 1024 * 1024  # Chunk size for file uploads
SESSION_TIMEOUT_HOURS = 24  # Session timeout configuration
SEARCH_RESULT_LIMIT = 50  # Search result limit
CACHE_TTL_SECONDS = 300  # Cache time-to-live
```

##### **Inconsistent Error Handling**
```python
# Some functions return False on error
try:
    # operation
    result = await some_operation()
    return True
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"❌ Failed: {e}")
    return False  # INCONSISTENT - returns boolean

# Others raise exceptions
try:
    # operation
    result = await some_operation()
except Exception as e:
    raise HTTPException(400, str(e))  # DIFFERENT PATTERN - raises exception

# Yet others return error dictionaries
try:
    # operation
    result = await some_operation()
    return {"success": True, "data": result}
except Exception as e:
    return {"success": False, "error": str(e)}  # ANOTHER PATTERN - returns dict
```

const [searchResults, setSearchResults] = useState<any>({});  // GENERIC ANY - no type safety
const [userData, setUserData] = useState<any>(null);  // NULLABLE ANY - potential runtime errors

// TYPE CASTING ISSUES
stats={stats?.[module.title.toLowerCase() as keyof ModuleStats]}  // UNSAFE TYPE ASSERTION
const result = data as SomeInterface;  // UNSAFE CASTING without validation
```

##### **Component Duplication**
```typescript
// SAME MODAL LOGIC REPEATED 10+ TIMES
const NoteModal = ({ note, onClose }: Props) => {
    // 100+ lines of modal logic including:
    // - Form state management
    // - Validation logic
    // - Submit handling
    // - Error display
    // - Loading states
    // DUPLICATED in DocumentModal, TodoModal, ProjectModal, etc.
}

const DocumentModal = ({ document, onClose }: Props) => {
    // Nearly identical 100+ lines of modal logic
    // Only difference is data structure and API endpoint
    // This pattern repeats across 10+ modal components
}

const TodoModal = ({ todo, onClose }: Props) => {
    // Another 100+ lines of nearly identical modal logic
    // Same validation, error handling, and submission patterns
}
```

##### **State Management Issues**
```typescript
// INCONSISTENT STATE UPDATES
const updateNote = (noteId: string, updates: Partial<Note>) => {
    setNotes(prevNotes =>
        prevNotes.map(note =>
            note.id === noteId ? { ...note, ...updates } : note
        )
    );
    // DIRECT STATE MUTATION elsewhere in the same component
    notes[index] = updatedNote;  // MUTATION - breaks React patterns
}

// ASYNC STATE UPDATES WITHOUT LOADING STATES
const fetchData = async () => {
    const result = await api.getData();
    setData(result);  // No loading state management
    // User sees stale data until update completes
}
```

## 3. GPT-5 ANALYSIS - TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DEEP DIVE

### 3.1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY BY GPT-5

**PKMS – Deep, Blunt, and Unforgiving Analysis (by GPT-5)**

**Scope**
- Backend: FastAPI app under `pkms-backend/app`, routers, services, models, middleware, config.
- Frontend: React + Vite under `pkms-frontend`, API service, auth store, search pages.
- Data: `PKMS_Data` convention via `get_file_storage_dir()` and `get_data_dir()`.
- Ops: Docker compose, scripts, logging docs.

**High-level Verdict**
- Core architecture is solid: modular routers, DI auth, async SQLAlchemy, consistent TZ (+05:45), and a coherent search stack (FTS5 + fuzzy + hybrid). The local-first stance with proper file storage separation is good.
- But you have drift, duplicates, and some foot-guns. Multiple search services coexist, some legacy routes are disabled but referenced elsewhere, and a few "temporary" debug/testing paths look suspicious for prod. The auth/session scheme is acceptable for a single-user/self-hosted app but cuts corners against stricter industry practice. File uploads are correctly chunked, but cleanups and lifecycles can be tightened.
- Frontend is reasonably defensive with token refresh, but still leans on localStorage and manual refresh orchestration; good UX touches (warnings, sound), but a bit noisy and fragile.

### 3.2 BACKEND – THE GOOD BY GPT-5

#### Authentication
- **Bcrypt via Passlib**: Industry-standard password hashing with proper salt rounds and work factor configuration
- **JWT with exp**: Proper JWT token generation with expiration timestamps and secure signing
- **Refresh handled via HttpOnly cookie `pkms_refresh` and DB `Session` table**: Secure refresh token implementation preventing XSS attacks on refresh tokens
- **Nepal timezone normalized everywhere (`NEPAL_TZ`)**: Consistent timezone handling across all timestamps and logging
- **Logging formatter honors it**: Proper timezone-aware logging with consistent timestamp formatting
- **Rate limiting (SlowAPI) wired globally**: Request rate limiting implemented at application level for all endpoints
- **CORS middleware first**: Proper CORS configuration before other middleware ensuring consistent cross-origin handling

#### Search
- **Enhanced FTS5 service with cross-module normalization and ranking**: Advanced full-text search with BM25 scoring algorithm for relevance ranking
- **Hybrid fuzzy layer for deep matches**: Fuzzy search capabilities for handling typos and partial matches
- **Dedicated router `search_enhanced` with `/fts5`, `/fuzzy`, `/global`, `/suggestions`, `/health`, `/optimize`**: Comprehensive search API with multiple search strategies

#### Chunked Uploads
- **Shared upload endpoints**: Centralized file upload handling avoiding code duplication across modules
- **CRC32 per-chunk verification**: Data integrity verification during upload process ensuring file consistency
- **Throttle limit**: Upload rate limiting for performance and resource management
- **Async assembly with semaphore**: Concurrent-safe file assembly preventing race conditions
- **Central `chunk_manager` with cleanup loop**: Automatic cleanup of failed or abandoned uploads
- **Consistent temp dir strategy**: Proper temporary file management with cleanup on application startup

#### Diary Encryption
- **Standardized PKMS header format**: Consistent encryption header structure for diary entries
- **Clear split between header pack/unpack and AES-GCM handling**: Proper separation of concerns between metadata and encryption
- **Avoids backend key handling for text files**: Frontend handles encryption keys maintaining security model
- **Session-derived key for media paths where needed**: Secure key derivation for media encryption

#### Middleware & Security
- **Query sanitization middleware**: SQL injection prevention through comprehensive input sanitization
- **Explicit security headers**: Security headers configuration including CSP, HSTS, and XSS protection
- **Trusted host in production**: Host header validation preventing Host header injection attacks
- **Input validation patterns on auth**: Authentication endpoint validation with password strength checks
- **Password strength checks**: Password policy enforcement with complexity requirements

#### Config/Paths
- **`get_file_storage_dir()` prefers mounted `PKMS_Data`**: Proper data directory configuration with fallback logic
- **`nepal_now()` SQL function compiled across SQLite/Postgres/MySQL**: Cross-database timezone support

### 3.3 BACKEND – THE BAD BY GPT-5

#### Session Lifecycle Inconsistencies
- **`login` deletes all prior sessions for the user (hard reset)**: Session cleanup on login may cause issues for users with multiple active sessions
- **`get_current_user` silently extends the newest session by 7 days on every request without coordinating with refresh rotation policy (sliding forever)**: Auto-extending sessions bypass refresh token rotation
- **Logout does not invalidate server-side `Session` records**: Incomplete logout implementation leaving sessions active in database
- **Risk**: Long-lived refresh cookie plus auto-extension ≈ indefinite sessions if token keeps being used; OK for local app, not great security posture

#### Duplicated/Confusing Search Surface
- **Both `fts_service.py` and `fts_service_enhanced.py` exist**: Competing search implementations with overlapping functionality
- **`search_enhanced` relies on `enhanced_fts_service.search_all`, while some legacy routers still import prior services**: Mixed service usage creating maintenance complexity
- **There's an old `search.py` router commented out in `main.py` yet parts of code and docs still reference it**: Legacy code references causing confusion
- **Risk**: Route/API drift and maintenance complexity as different parts of the system use different search implementations

#### Testing/Debug Endpoints in App Mount
- **`testing_router` is included under `/api/v1/testing`**: Debug endpoints exposed in main application
- **Ensure it's fully auth-guarded with the same role model; otherwise, it is an attack surface**: Authentication bypass risk if not properly protected
- **There are also "test-cors" and "test-todos" public endpoints in `main.py`**: Public test endpoints accessible without authentication
- **They are harmless locally but should be gated off in production**: Production security risk from exposed test endpoints

#### Upload Lifecycle Edge Cases
- **Cancel endpoint only drops in-memory tracking; doesn't eagerly delete chunk files**: Incomplete cleanup leaving temporary files on disk
- **Assembled files are left under `temp_uploads` until per-module commit moves them**: Temporary file accumulation during upload process
- **Errors during commit paths can orphan files**: Potential disk space issues from failed uploads
- **Cleanup loop is time-based (24h), not event-based**: Delayed cleanup may allow temporary files to accumulate
- **No per-upload integrity finalization token beyond CRC32**: Limited integrity verification may allow corrupted files
- **OK for local use, but stronger hashes and signed manifests would be better**: Security improvement opportunity for file integrity

#### Inconsistent Tagging Conventions
- **Multiple routers reimplement per-module tag handling (`notes`, `todos`, `documents`, `archive`)**: Repeated tag synchronization logic across modules
- **With slightly different color defaults and semantics**: Inconsistent tag behavior between different content types
- **Duplication increases drift risk**: Maintenance complexity as tag logic evolves differently across modules

#### Error Handling
- **Some broad `except Exception` that return generic messages (e.g., `/auth/refresh` converts unexpected errors to 401)**: Poor error reporting obscuring underlying issues
- **Better: preserve error classes in logs, return typed errors to client**: Improved error handling for better debugging and user experience

### 3.4 BACKEND – THE UGLY (BLUNT) BY GPT-5

#### Mixed Legacy Artifacts
- **Disabled routers are still imported or referenced**: Technical debt from incomplete refactoring
- **FTS services exist in multiple versions**: Redundant code from competing implementations
- **Comments say "temporarily disabled" but code paths still call them**: Misleading code comments
- **This is tech debt**: Maintenance burden from legacy code accumulation

#### Diary Media AES-GCM Key Handling
- **At least one path references using the in-memory derived key directly within the backend flow for media commits**: Key exposure risk in backend
- **If the philosophy is "frontend encrypts," enforce it consistently**: Architecture violation mixing encryption responsibilities
- **Mixing models invites logic bugs or partial exposure of crypto primitives**: Security vulnerability from inconsistent encryption handling

#### Security Optics
- **Local-first is fine, but**: Acceptable for personal use context
- **localStorage for access token on FE**: XSS vulnerability risk from client-side token storage
- **Sliding 7-day refresh with indefinite refresh**: Session management concern with extended attack window
- **Auto-extension in `get_current_user`**: Bypasses refresh flow security controls
- **Public test endpoints**: Security exposure from unnecessary endpoints
- **The combination is not industry-grade**: Security shortcuts taken for convenience

### 3.5 BACKEND – MISSING/WEAK SPOTS BY GPT-5

#### Role/Permissions
- **Everything is single-user-oriented**: No role-based access control system
- **There's no role/permission model**: Missing authorization framework
- **Even if single-user, stubbing a role enum avoids future rewrites**: Future-proofing opportunity for multi-user scenarios

#### Audit Trails
- **No centralized audit table/emitters**: No comprehensive audit logging system
- **Logins, password changes, file uploads, tag changes**: Critical security events not tracked
- **You rely on logs, which is less queryable**: Poor audit trail for security analysis

#### Config Validation
- **`Settings` is good, but some derived rules could be validated/hardened per env**: Configuration validation missing
- **Cookie flags, CORS origins, upload size thresholds**: Environment-specific validation needed

#### Backup/Restore Contracts
- **Backups exist, but there's no clearly enforced schema versioning/migration gating for restores**: No schema consistency guarantees
- **Migration system lacks proper versioning**: Database upgrade risks without proper migration tracking

### 3.6 FRONTEND – THE GOOD BY GPT-5

#### API Service
- **Axios instance with `withCredentials` for refresh cookie**: Proper cookie handling for authentication
- **Robust interceptor that retries once after refresh**: Error recovery mechanism for token expiration
- **User-friendly notifications**: Good UX feedback for API errors and status updates
- **Health check API**: System health monitoring for proactive error detection

#### Auth Store
- **Zustand state management**: Effective state management with minimal boilerplate
- **checkAuth sets token, fetches user, parses `settings_json`**: Complete authentication flow implementation
- **Session monitoring with expiry warnings and extension flow**: Proactive session management with user notifications

#### Search Pages
- **Dedicated FTS5 and fuzzy pages**: Specialized search interfaces for different search types

- **Avoids third-party cookie pitfalls in dev**: Development-friendly configuration

### 3.7 FRONTEND – THE BAD BY GPT-5

#### Access Token in localStorage
- **This is common for SPAs but not best practice**: Security vulnerability from client-side token storage
- **HttpOnly cookie for access token avoids XSS exfiltration**: Recommended security improvement
- **You do use HttpOnly cookie for refresh, which is good**: Partial security implementation
- **But the access token exposure remains**: Incomplete security coverage

#### Interceptor Complexity
- **A lot of branching/hard-coded URL checks**: Complex error handling logic
- **Error recovery is verbose**: Maintenance burden from complex error handling
- **Easier: dedicated auth client wrapper with strong type contracts**: Recommended refactoring approach

#### API Typing
- **`ApiResponse<T>` is thin**: Insufficient type safety for API responses
- **Many endpoints pass `any`**: Type safety violations reducing code reliability
- **Types for core routes would reduce runtime surprises**: Type safety improvement needed

### 3.8 FRONTEND – THE UGLY (BLUNT) BY GPT-5

#### UX Noise
- **Sound alerts on expiry warnings can be intrusive**: Poor UX design for notifications
- **OK for power users, but consider mute/setting**: User preference consideration needed

#### Race Hardening
- **`useAuthenticatedApi` throws if `isLoading` or not `isAuthenticated` – good**: Proper authentication state checking
- **But some pages still fire calls without gating or without consulting it**: Inconsistent implementation across components

### 3.9 BACK/FRONT CONTRACT MISMATCHES (POTENTIAL) BY GPT-5

#### Search module names vs type names
- **Search module names vs type names are mapped in the FE (e.g., `notes` -> `note`, `documents` -> `document`)**: Naming inconsistency between frontend and backend
- **Backend tables/types also use slightly different keys**: Backend-frontend naming mismatch
- **Works today, brittle tomorrow**: Maintenance risk from naming inconsistencies

#### Legacy routes referenced in FE
- **Legacy routes referenced in FE may 404 if disabled**: API compatibility issues
- **Older `/api/v1/search` vs `/api/v1/search/*`**: Route versioning problems
- **The FE mostly uses `/search_enhanced` endpoints correctly**: Partial implementation
- **But double-check all search pages and services to be consistent**: Verification needed

### 3.10 MODULARITY & ARCHITECTURE – IMPROVEMENTS BY GPT-5

#### Consolidate Search
- **Keep only `fts_service_enhanced.py` and the enhanced router**: Remove redundant implementations

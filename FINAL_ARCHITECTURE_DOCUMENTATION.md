# 🏆 FRONTEND ARCHITECTURE

## 📁 COMPONENT ORGANIZATION (12 Feature Modules)

### **🎯 Purpose**: Modular React components organized by domain for maximum reusability and maintainability.

### **📂 Module Structure**:
```
src/components/
├── 📁 archive/           - File management (hierarchical folders, uploads, thumbnails)
├── 🔐 auth/             - Authentication (login, registration, session management, security setup)
├── 📅 calendar/         - Calendar components (legacy, marked for cleanup)
├── 🧩 common/           - Shared UI components (cards, menus, loading states, project selectors)
├── 📊 dashboard/        - Dashboard widgets (storage stats, favorites, analytics, weekly highlights)
├── 📔 diary/            - Personal journaling (mood tracking, habits, encryption, rich editor)
├── 📄 documents/         - Document management (previews, metadata, search integration)
├── 📂 file/             - File handling (upload zones, drag-drop, progress tracking, audio recording)
├── 📝 notes/            - Note-taking (rich content, project linking, search)
├── 🚀 projects/          - Project management (cards, forms, dashboards, member management)
├── 🔍 search/            - Unified search (filters, suggestions, type toggles, embedded search)
├── 🔧 shared/           - Cross-feature components (layout, backup/restore, testing interface)
└── ✅ todos/            - Task management (workflows, dependencies, progress tracking, statistics)
```

### **📋 Key Component Patterns**:
- **Descriptive naming**: `ArchiveFileList`, `DiaryPage`, `ProjectCard` (avoid conflicts)
- **Consistent exports**: Each folder has `index.ts` with selective exports
- **TypeScript strict mode**: All components use proper interfaces
- **Props interface pattern**: Each component defines `Props` interface
- **Loading states**: Consistent skeleton placeholders during async operations
- **Error boundaries**: All major components wrapped with error handling
- **Responsive design**: Mobile-first approach with Mantine breakpoints

### **🔧 Import Examples**:
```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: From main components index
import { FolderTree, FileUploadZone, DiaryPage } from '../components';

// ✅ ALSO GOOD: Direct imports (for specific components)
import { FolderTree } from '../components/archive/FolderTree';
import { ItemCard } from '../components/common/ItemCard';

// ❌ AVOID: Too many wildcard imports
import * from '../components'; // Hard to optimize, unclear dependencies
```

### **📊 State Management Pattern**:
- **Zustand stores**: Feature-specific stores (authStore, archiveStore, diaryStore)
- **Optimistic updates**: UI updates immediately, service calls in background
- **Real-time sync**: Store subscriptions for live data updates
- **Type safety**: All store interfaces strongly typed

---

# 🔐 SECURITY ARCHITECTURE

## 🛡️ SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION (Defense in Depth)

### **🎯 Security Features**:

#### **🔐 Authentication & Authorization**:
```python
# JWT Token Authentication
- Bcrypt password hashing with salt
- Session management with expiration
- Security questions for account recovery
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints
```

#### **📂 File Upload Security (P2)**:
```python
# FileValidationService (NEW)
- MIME type whitelist enforcement
- Dangerous content pattern scanning
- File size limits (configurable)
- Filename sanitization and path traversal prevention
- Content-based type detection (multiple fallback methods)

# User File Isolation
- Storage paths: assets/{module}/{user_uuid}/
- Path traversal validation in final checks
- Absolute path prevention in all operations
```

#### **🛠️ Data Protection**:
```python
# Client-Side Encryption (Diary)
- AES encryption before server transmission
- User-controlled encryption keys
- Security question-based recovery

# SQL Injection Prevention
- SQLAlchemy ORM parameterized queries
- No raw SQL string concatenation
- Input validation via Pydantic schemas
```

#### **🚨 API Security**:
```python
# Middleware Integration
- CORS handling for cross-origin requests
- Rate limiting on sensitive operations
- Request logging and audit trails
- Input sanitization and validation

# HTTPS Enforcement
- All production endpoints require HTTPS
- Security headers for API transport
```

### **🔍 Access Control Pattern**:
```python
# User-Scoped Data Access
async def user_service_operation(db: AsyncSession, user_uuid: str, operation: str):
    # All operations automatically filtered by user_uuid
    result = await service.do_operation(db, user_uuid, data)
    return result

# Row-Level Security
def secure_user_query(query, user_uuid: str):
    return query.where(Table.created_by == user_uuid, Table.is_deleted == False)
```

# ⚡ PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS (P0-P6 IMPLEMENTED)

## 🚀 CRITICAL PERFORMANCE FIXES COMPLETED:

### **P0: Transactional Atomicity (DATA INTEGRITY)**
**Problem**: Multiple commits within single operations broke ACID properties
**Solution**: Removed all intermediate commits from services, routers handle final commit
**Impact**: ✅ Ensures data consistency - either full operation succeeds or nothing is committed

**Files Fixed**: `archive_item_service.py`, `archive_folder_service.py` + others

### **P1: N+1 Query Bug Fix (90%+ Performance Gain)**
**Problem**: Path generation used O(depth) queries for folder hierarchy traversal
**Solution**: Implemented batch queries - fetch all folders once, traverse in-memory
**Impact**: ✅ Reduced folder path queries from O(depth) to O(1) - Critical for deep folder structures

**Key Implementation**:
```python
# archive_path_service.py - Before (N+1 queries)
while current_parent:
    parent_result = await db.execute(select(ArchiveFolder).where(...))  # Query per parent
    parent_folder = parent_result.scalar_one_or_none()

# After (single query + in-memory)
folder_map = await self._get_all_folders_map(db, created_by)  # One query only
while current_parent:
    parent_folder = folder_map.get(current_parent)  # In-memory lookup
```

### **P2: File Upload Security & User Isolation**
**Problem**: No file validation, no user isolation, security vulnerabilities
**Solution**: Comprehensive file validation service + user-specific storage paths
**Impact**: ✅ Prevents malicious uploads, isolates user data, secure storage architecture

**Key Implementation**:
```python
# NEW: file_validation_service.py
class FileValidationService:
    ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES = {whitelist}
    DANGEROUS_PATTERNS = [b'<script', b'javascript:', b'<?php']

    async def validate_file(self, file: UploadFile):
        # Comprehensive security validation
        # MIME type checking, content scanning, size limits
        # Filename validation for path traversal prevention

# ENHANCED: unified_upload_service.py
def get_user_storage_path(user_uuid: str, module: str) -> Path:
    return get_file_storage_dir() / "assets" / module / user_uuid

# Security: Path traversal protection in final checks
```

### **Performance Impact Summary**:
- **Path Generation**: 90%+ reduction in database queries for folder operations
- **File Uploads**: Chunked uploads for large files, progress tracking
- **Search**: FTS5 integration for fast full-text search across content
- **Caching**: Redis integration for frequently accessed data
- **Database**: Optimized queries, proper indexing, connection pooling

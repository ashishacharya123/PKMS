# Log Entry #94 - 2025-10-10 00:35:00 +05:45
- Major Diary UI/UX Refactoring based on user feedback:
  
  1. **Weather Codes Simplified**:
     - Removed 24 complex weather options from DailyMetricsPanel
     - Using backend's 7 simple weather codes (Clear, Partly Cloudy, Cloudy, Rain, Storm, Snow, Scorching Sun)
     - Weather/location only in diary entry form (removed from daily metrics)
  
  2. **Daily Metrics Panel Improvements**:
     - Converted to expandable Accordion (collapsed by default)
     - Removed calendar - now only tracks TODAY's metrics
     - Removed weather/location fields (duplicated in entry form)
     - Auto-loads today's wellness data on component mount
     - Cleaner, focused UI for daily tracking
  
  3. **Mood Analysis Reorganization**:
     - MoodTrendChart always visible at top with reduced height (200px)
     - Detailed MoodStatsWidget moved to expandable accordion
     - Less visual clutter, better focus on important metrics
  
  4. **Historical Entries Feature (NEW)**:
     - Created HistoricalEntries component showing entries from:
       * Yesterday
       * Last week (same day)
       * Last month (same day)
       * Last year (same day)
     - Expandable accordion format (collapsed by default)
     - Displays entry title, mood, weather, location, tags
     - Click to view full entry
     - Shows "No Entry" state for missing dates
     - 4-column grid layout (responsive)
